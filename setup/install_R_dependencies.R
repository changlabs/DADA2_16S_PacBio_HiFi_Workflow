# Script: install_R_dependencies.R
# Purpose:
#   - Install all R packages required to run the PacBio HiFi DADA2 16S amplicon
#     workflow, including core packages and the optional downstream copy-
#     number-correction and microbial-load-correction notebooks:
#     data-manipulation libraries, Bioconductor packages (dada2, phyloseq,
#     ShortRead, Biostrings, DECIPHER), visualization tools, and the
#     reporting packages.
#   - Provide clear progress feedback at every installation step so the user
#     can follow along and quickly identify failures.
#   - Verify that every package loaded correctly after installation and print a
#     human-readable summary showing how many packages succeeded or failed.
#   - Report the installed version of each critical Bioconductor package and the
#     active R / Bioconductor version for reproducibility documentation.
#
# Note on optional downstream steps:
#   Every R package used by the optional copy-number-correction and microbial-
#   load/QMP-correction notebooks — Biostrings,
#   phyloseq, openxlsx, dplyr, readr, here — is already installed by this
#   script as part of the core dependency set below; no separate R
#   installation step is required for either optional notebook. Copy-number
#   correction does, however, require PICRUSt2, which is NOT an R package
#   and is therefore installed separately — see setup/install_picrust2.sh.
#
# When to run this script:
#   Run this script ONCE after cloning or downloading the repository for the
#   first time, or whenever you set up a new R environment (e.g., a new conda
#   environment, a new RStudio project on a different machine, or after a major
#   R version upgrade). You do NOT need to re-run it on every analysis session.
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - R >= 4.1.0  (required by current DADA2 and phyloseq releases)
#   - An active internet connection (CRAN and Bioconductor servers must be reachable)
#   - Sufficient disk space (~2-3 GB for all packages and their compiled objects)
#
# Output:
#   - Packages are installed into your active R library path (.libPaths()[1]).
#   - Package files are written only to the active R library; project data and
#     analysis results are not modified.
#   - A final summary table is printed to the console showing success/failure
#     status and version strings for the key Bioconductor packages.
#
# Troubleshooting:
#   - If a CRAN package fails, try installing it manually:
#       install.packages("<package_name>", dependencies = TRUE)
#   - If a Bioconductor package fails, ensure BiocManager is up to date:
#       install.packages("BiocManager")
#       BiocManager::install("<package_name>", update = FALSE, ask = FALSE)
#   - On Linux, some packages (e.g., xml2, curl, openssl) require system
#     libraries. Install them with your package manager first, for example:
#       sudo apt-get install libxml2-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libssl-dev
#   - On macOS with Apple Silicon, use an ARM-native R build from CRAN.

# Helper function: install_if_missing
# ==============================================================================
# Rather than calling install.packages() or BiocManager::install() directly
# everywhere in the script, we centralise the install-and-verify logic in this
# single helper. It checks whether the package is already present (skipping the
# download if it is), attempts the appropriate install command, and immediately
# confirms whether the install succeeded.
#
# Arguments:
#   packages  : Character vector of package names to check and install.
#   source    : Either "CRAN" (default) or "Bioconductor". Controls which
#               backend is used for packages not already present.
#
# Behaviour:
#   - Packages that are already available produce a "✓ already installed" line.
#   - Packages that need installing produce "Installing: <name> ..." followed
#     by either "✓ installed successfully" or "✗ Failed to install <name>".
#   - The function does NOT stop the script on failure; it merely reports the
#     failure so all packages are attempted before the user reviews the summary.

# These five packages are the analytical core of the DADA2 amplicon workflow.
# They must be installed via BiocManager because they are part of the
# Bioconductor project, which maintains coordinated release cycles and has
# stricter quality requirements than CRAN.
#
#   dada2       : The primary amplicon denoising engine. Implements the DADA2
#                 algorithm for high-resolution inference of exact amplicon
#                 sequence variants (ASVs), including PacBio HiFi reads via
#                 the PacBioErrfun error model.
#                 Reference: Callahan et al. (2016) Nature Methods.
#
#   ShortRead   : Input/output and quality assessment for short-read sequencing
#                 data. Used to read FASTQ files and generate per-base quality
#                 score summaries.
#
#   Biostrings  : Efficient manipulation of biological sequences (DNA, RNA,
#                 amino acid). Used for reverse-complement operations and
#                 primer trimming logic.
#
#   DECIPHER    : Sequence alignment toolkit used to align ASV sequences before
#                 downstream phylogenetic-tree construction.
#
#   phyloseq    : Container and analysis framework for microbiome data that
#                 integrates OTU/ASV tables, taxonomy tables, sample metadata,
#                 phylogenetic trees, and reference sequences into a single object.
#                 Also used by optional microbial-load/QMP correction via
#                 phyloseq::rarefy_even_depth().
#
#   Biostrings is also used by optional 16S copy-number correction to convert
#   Step 5's ASV sequences into a FASTA file
#   for PICRUSt2's place_seqs.py. PICRUSt2 itself is an external (non-R) tool
