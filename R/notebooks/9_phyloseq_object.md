# Introduction

## Purpose

This notebook is **Step 9**, the final step, of the 16S rRNA sequencing
data processing pipeline. It constructs one or more
[phyloseq](https://joey711.github.io/phyloseq/) objects from the ASV
count table(s) and taxonomy assignments generated earlier in the
pipeline. The phyloseq object is a powerful data structure that
integrates sample data, taxonomy, and optionally phylogenetic trees for
comprehensive microbiome analysis.

Because this notebook runs last, it automatically detects and picks up
the output of every optional upstream step that was run: for each
taxonomy database detected on disk ([SILVA](https://www.arb-silva.de/)
and/or [GTDB](https://gtdb.ecogenomic.org/) – whichever one or both were
produced by Step 5), it builds **up to three phyloseq objects** — one
from **raw counts** (Step 5, always available), one from
**copy-number-corrected counts** (Step 7, if that optional notebook was
run), and one from **microbial-load-corrected counts** (Step 8, if that
optional notebook was run). Any combination whose input file is not
found is skipped automatically, with a clear message explaining why.
Every database’s results — phyloseq objects, barplots, and summary
workbook — are kept in their own subfolder, so SILVA- and GTDB-based
outputs never mix.

The combined dataset is documented in this HTML report. When Step 5
contains `separate_pools/`, the notebook also constructs the valid
object combinations independently for every pool and lists the resulting
pool folders, while avoiding repeated pool-level tables and plots in the
combined report.

## Prerequisites

Before running this notebook, ensure that:

1.  **[Step 5 (DADA2 Pipeline)](5_dada2_pipeline.md)** has been
    completed successfully.
2.  The ASV count table
    ([asv_count_table.csv](../../results/5_dada2_pipeline/asv_count_table.csv))
    is present in
    [results/5_dada2_pipeline/](../../results/5_dada2_pipeline/).
3.  At least one taxonomy table is present
    ([silva_taxonomy_table.csv](../../results/5_dada2_pipeline/silva_taxonomy_table.csv)
    and/or
    [gtdb_taxonomy_table.csv](../../results/5_dada2_pipeline/gtdb_taxonomy_table.csv)).
4.  **Optional**: [Step 7 (Copy Number
    Correction)](7_copy_number_correction.md) has been run, to
    additionally build a copy-number-corrected phyloseq object per
    taxonomy database.
5.  **Optional**: [Step 8 (Microbial Load
    Correction)](8_microbial_load_correction.md) has been run, to
    additionally build a microbial-load-corrected phyloseq object per
    taxonomy database.
6.  **Optional**: A sample metadata file in TSV (or CSV) format – see
    [data/README.md](../../data/README.md) for the required identifiers
    and editable example fields. Replace the demonstration rows and
    annotations in [data/metadata.tsv](../../data/metadata.tsv) before
    interpreting metadata-based groupings.
7.  **Optional**: Phylogenetic trees from [Step
    6](6_phylogenetic_tree.md).

## What This Notebook Does

The workflow accomplishes the following tasks:

1.  **Import Data**: Loads whichever abundance table(s) are available
    (raw, copy-number-corrected, microbial-load-corrected), taxonomy
    assignments, and optional metadata/phylogenetic tree.
2.  **Construct Phyloseq Objects**: Creates one integrated data
    structure per (taxonomy database x available abundance source)
    combination.
3.  **Data Exploration**: Summarizes the composition and taxonomy of
    every phyloseq object built.
4.  **Taxonomic Aggregation**: Aggregates data at the Genus level for
    every phyloseq object.
5.  **Relative Abundance**: Calculates relative abundance
    transformations.
6.  **Visualization**: Generates an interactive top-taxa Genus-level
    barplot for each phyloseq object that contains at least one
    classified genus, using a shared genus-to-color mapping.
7.  **Export**: Saves every phyloseq object for downstream analysis.

## Expected Input

- **Always required**, from
  [results/5_dada2_pipeline/](../../results/5_dada2_pipeline/) (Step 5):
  - [asv_count_table.csv](../../results/5_dada2_pipeline/asv_count_table.csv)
    — raw ASV abundance matrix.
  - [silva_taxonomy_table.csv](../../results/5_dada2_pipeline/silva_taxonomy_table.csv)
    and/or
    [gtdb_taxonomy_table.csv](../../results/5_dada2_pipeline/gtdb_taxonomy_table.csv)
    — taxonomy assignments.
- **Optional**, automatically included if present:
  - [results/7_copy_number_correction/copy_number_corrected_asv_count_table.csv](../../results/7_copy_number_correction/copy_number_corrected_asv_count_table.csv)
    (Step 7).
  - [results/8_microbial_load_correction/microbial_load_corrected_abundance_table.csv](../../results/8_microbial_load_correction/microbial_load_corrected_abundance_table.csv)
    (Step 8).
  - [results/6_phylogenetic_tree/phylogenetic_tree.nwk](../../results/6_phylogenetic_tree/phylogenetic_tree.nwk)
    (Step 6).
  - Sample metadata TSV (or CSV) file – see
    [data/README.md](../../data/README.md).

## Expected Output

Every output below is split into one self-contained subfolder per
taxonomy database under
[results/9_phyloseq_object/](../../results/9_phyloseq_object/) –
e.g. [results/9_phyloseq_object/SILVA/](../../results/9_phyloseq_object/SILVA/)
and/or
[results/9_phyloseq_object/GTDB/](../../results/9_phyloseq_object/GTDB/)
– rather than a single flat folder mixing both databases together, since
a phyloseq object (and everything derived from one) is always specific
to exactly one taxonomy database. Within each database’s own subfolder,
the `.RData` objects and the interactive barplots are further split into
their own
[phyloseq_objects/](../../results/9_phyloseq_object/SILVA/phyloseq_objects/)
and [barplots/](../../results/9_phyloseq_object/SILVA/barplots/)
subfolders.

- Up to three phyloseq objects per taxonomy database, saved as `.RData`
  files (one per available abundance source),
  e.g. [SILVA/phyloseq_objects/phyloseq_object_silva_raw_counts.RData](../../results/9_phyloseq_object/SILVA/phyloseq_objects/phyloseq_object_silva_raw_counts.RData).
- One interactive HTML barplot per phyloseq object containing classified
  genera – the top `n_top_taxa` genera by relative abundance, excluding
  unclassified/NA genera. Objects with no classified genus are retained,
  but their top-genus table and plot are skipped with a warning.
- A summary statistics Excel workbook per taxonomy database,
  e.g. [SILVA/phyloseq_summary_silva.xlsx](../../results/9_phyloseq_object/SILVA/phyloseq_summary_silva.xlsx),
  containing `Tax_Summary`, per-source `Top_Genera_*`/`Sample_Stats_*`,
  `Run_Provenance`, and a trailing `Column_Dictionary` sheet.
- Genus-level aggregated objects are intermediate in-memory objects used
  to generate the summary tables and barplots; they are not separate
  disk outputs.

source(here("R", "functions", "workflow_paths_function.R"))
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Configuration

## Define Path Parameters

Set up the input and output directory paths. Using `here()` ensures
paths are relative to the [project root](../../), making the script
portable across different systems.

``` r
# Base results folder for all pipeline outputs
results_folder <- workflow_results_dir()

# A blank pool name processes the combined inputs. A pool-specific render uses
# the same pool folder at every available upstream step.
pool_name <- trimws(params$pool_name)
pool_mode <- nzchar(pool_name)
pool_path <- function(step_folder) {
    if (pool_mode) here(results_folder, step_folder, "separate_pools", pool_name) else here(results_folder, step_folder)
}

# Required and optional upstream result folders.
dada2_results_folder <- pool_path("5_dada2_pipeline")
tree_results_folder <- pool_path("6_phylogenetic_tree")
copy_number_results_folder <- pool_path("7_copy_number_correction")
microbial_load_results_folder <- pool_path("8_microbial_load_correction")

# Keep each pool's final deliverables isolated under separate_pools/<pool_name>.
# Step 9 writes directly to this final output folder.
output_folder <- pool_path("9_phyloseq_object")

# Create the output directory if it does not already exist
if (dir_exists(output_folder)) dir_delete(output_folder)
dir_create(output_folder, recurse = TRUE)

cat("Created the Step 9 output directory:\n", output_folder, "\n")

# Every output this notebook writes -- phyloseq .RData objects, barplots, and
# the summary workbook -- is split into one self-contained subfolder per
# taxonomy database (e.g. results/9_phyloseq_object/SILVA/,
# results/9_phyloseq_object/GTDB/) rather than a single flat folder mixing
# both databases' files together, since a phyloseq object (and everything
# derived from one) is always specific to exactly one taxonomy database.
# Within each database's own subfolder, the .RData phyloseq objects and the
# interactive HTML barplots are further split into their own "phyloseq_objects/"
# and "barplots/" subfolders, so the two file types never mix even within a
# single database. The summary Excel workbook is neither a raw object nor a
# plot, so it stays directly in the database's own top-level subfolder rather
# than nested in either.
# All helpers below are functions of db_name (not fixed path variables) --
# called with the current combo's meta$db_name everywhere a
# database-specific path is needed -- rather than fixed variables, because
# which database(s) are actually processed is only known once Load Taxonomy
# Table(s) below has run. Each folder helper creates its folder on first use,
# so every chunk that writes a database-specific file can call it directly
# without a separate setup step.

# Returns (and creates, if necessary) the top-level per-database output
# subfolder for db_name (e.g. "SILVA" or "GTDB").
db_output_folder <- function(db_name) {
    folder <- here(output_folder, db_name)
    dir_create(folder)
    folder
}

# Returns (and creates) db_name's "phyloseq_objects/" subfolder, for its
# saved .RData phyloseq objects.
db_phyloseq_folder <- function(db_name) {
    folder <- here(db_output_folder(db_name), "phyloseq_objects")
    dir_create(folder)
    folder
}

# Returns (and creates) db_name's "barplots/" subfolder, for its interactive
# HTML barplots.
db_barplot_folder <- function(db_name) {
    folder <- here(db_output_folder(db_name), "barplots")
    dir_create(folder)
    folder
}

# Returns the path to db_name's own summary Excel workbook, directly inside
# its top-level per-database output subfolder (not nested in either
# phyloseq_objects/ or barplots/).
db_excel_path <- function(db_name) {
    here(db_output_folder(db_name), paste0("phyloseq_summary_", tolower(db_name), ".xlsx"))
}
```

The resolved configuration is printed below so the report records
whether it is processing the combined dataset or one pool and which
optional inputs were requested.

## Define Data Selection Parameters

Configure the optional components to include. Which **taxonomy
database(s)** (SILVA / GTDB) and **abundance sources** (raw /
copy-number-corrected / microbial-load-corrected) get included is not
configured here — both are detected automatically, in [Load Taxonomy
Table(s)](#load-taxonomy) and [Load Abundance Tables](#load-abundance)
below respectively, based on which output files are actually present on
disk.

``` r
# Path to sample metadata file (optional)
# Set to NULL if no metadata is available. Accepts either a tab-separated
# (.tsv/.txt) or comma-separated (.csv) file, detected automatically from the
# file extension -- sample identifiers must be in the first column, matching
# the SampleID convention used throughout this workflow (the text before the
# first underscore in each FASTQ filename; see data/README.md). See
# data/README.md for the full required format.
#
# Defaults to the ready-to-edit template shipped at data/metadata.tsv, which
# contains generic Sample01-Sample06 IDs and placeholder values. Replace its rows
# and values with your own before drawing conclusions from metadata-based
# groupings. Set to NULL to build phyloseq
# objects without any metadata.
metadata_path <- workflow_data_dir("metadata.tsv")

# Whether to include the phylogenetic tree (if available from Step 6)
include_tree <- TRUE

# Number of top taxa to display in visualizations
n_top_taxa <- 10

if (length(include_tree) != 1L || !is.logical(include_tree) || is.na(include_tree)) {
    stop("include_tree must be exactly TRUE or FALSE.")
}
if (length(n_top_taxa) != 1L || !is.numeric(n_top_taxa) || is.logical(n_top_taxa) ||
    !is.finite(n_top_taxa) || n_top_taxa < 1 ||
    n_top_taxa != as.integer(n_top_taxa)) {
    stop("n_top_taxa must be one positive integer.")
}

# Display configuration
cat("Data Selection Configuration:\n",
    "- Taxonomy database(s): auto-detected below, in Load Taxonomy Table(s)\n",
    "- Metadata file:", ifelse(is.null(metadata_path), "Not provided", metadata_path), "\n",
    "- Include phylogenetic tree:", include_tree, "\n",

```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Import Data

## Load Abundance Tables

This notebook can automatically build phyloseq objects from up to three
abundance tables. **Raw counts** (Step 5) are always required;
**copy-number-corrected** (Step 7) and **microbial-load-corrected**
(Step 8) counts are picked up automatically if their output files exist,
and skipped – with a message, not an error – otherwise.

``` r
# Registry of every abundance-table source this notebook knows how to build a
# phyloseq object from. `required = TRUE` means the notebook stops if the
# file is missing; `required = FALSE` means it is silently skipped (with a
# message) if the corresponding optional upstream step was not run.
# `label` is a short, Excel-sheet-name-safe tag (sheet names cannot exceed 31
# characters) used only when constructing per-sheet names later in this
# notebook -- file names, list/variable names, and console messages all use
# the full `display` name instead.
abundance_source_definitions <- list(
    raw_counts = list(
        display  = "Raw Counts",
        label    = "Raw",
        path     = here(dada2_results_folder, "asv_count_table.csv"),
        required = TRUE,
        provenance = NULL
    ),
    copy_number_corrected = list(
        display  = "Copy-Number Corrected",
        label    = "CN_Corrected",
        path     = here(copy_number_results_folder, "copy_number_corrected_asv_count_table.csv"),
        required = FALSE,
        provenance = here(copy_number_results_folder, "copy_number_correction_summary.xlsx")
    ),
    microbial_load_corrected = list(
        display  = "Microbial-Load Corrected",
        label    = "ML_Corrected",
        path     = here(microbial_load_results_folder, "microbial_load_corrected_abundance_table.csv"),
        required = FALSE,
        provenance = here(microbial_load_results_folder, "microbial_load_correction_summary.xlsx")
    )
)
```

With the reusable import and validation helpers defined, the next chunk
loads the required raw table and any current optional corrected
abundance tables.

``` r

# leading `SampleID` column followed by one column per ASV) and returns it as

The report lists the abundance sources that passed provenance and
sample-set validation and will be used to build phyloseq objects.

## Load Taxonomy Table(s)

This chunk automatically detects which taxonomy database(s) Step 5
produced – SILVA, GTDB, or both – and loads whichever are actually
present, exactly mirroring the auto-detection already used for the
abundance sources above ([Load Abundance Tables](#load-abundance)). A
database whose file is missing is skipped with a message, not an error;
the chunk only stops if *neither* database’s file can be found, since a
phyloseq object cannot be built without at least one taxonomy
assignment.

``` r
# Registry of every taxonomy database this notebook knows how to look for.
# Mirrors the abundance_source_definitions registry above: each entry is
# skipped, with a message, if its file is not found -- there is no
# "required" database, since any one of SILVA or GTDB is sufficient to
# build a phyloseq object.
taxonomy_database_paths <- list(
    SILVA = here(dada2_results_folder, "silva_taxonomy_table.csv"),
    GTDB  = here(dada2_results_folder, "gtdb_taxonomy_table.csv")
)

taxonomy_files <- list()

for (db_name in names(taxonomy_database_paths)) {

    db_path <- taxonomy_database_paths[[db_name]]

    if (file_exists(db_path)) {
        taxonomy_files[[db_name]] <- db_path
        cat(db_name, "taxonomy file found:", db_path, "\n")
    } else {
        cat("-", db_name, "taxonomy file not found -- skipping.\n",
            "   Expected at:", db_path, "\n")
    }
}
```

The next gate requires at least one current SILVA or GTDB taxonomy table
before object construction can proceed.

``` r
# Check that at least one taxonomy file was found
if (length(taxonomy_files) == 0) {
    stop("No taxonomy files found! Expected at least one of:\n",
         paste0("  - ", unlist(taxonomy_database_paths), collapse = "\n"),
         "\nPlease ensure Step 5 (DADA2 Pipeline) has been completed with at least one taxonomy database.")
}

cat("\nTaxonomy database(s) available for this run:", paste(names(taxonomy_files), collapse = ", "), "\n")
```

Available taxonomy tables are now loaded, normalized to a common rank
layout, and checked against the Step 5 ASV identifiers.

## Load Sample Metadata (Optional)

If `metadata_path` was set above, this chunk loads it (auto-detecting a
tab- or comma-separated file from its extension – see
[data/README.md](../../data/README.md) for the required format) and
checks that its sample identifiers actually match the abundance table’s
samples – a phyloseq object is still built without metadata, but any
downstream grouping/faceting by a metadata variable requires this to
succeed.

``` r
sample_metadata <- NULL

if (!is.null(metadata_path) && !file_exists(metadata_path)) {
    message("Metadata file not found; continuing without sample metadata: ", metadata_path)
    metadata_path <- NULL
}

if (!is.null(metadata_path) && file_exists(metadata_path)) {

    # Delimiter is inferred from the file extension, so this notebook accepts
    # either a tab-separated (.tsv/.txt, this project's convention -- see

    # extra configuration.

## Load Phylogenetic Tree (Optional)

If `include_tree` is `TRUE` and Step 6’s output is present, this chunk
loads the Newick tree so it can be incorporated into the phyloseq
object(s) below (enabling phylogeny-aware analyses like UniFrac
downstream); it is skipped gracefully, with an explanatory message, if
Step 6 was not run.

``` r
phylo_tree <- NULL

if (include_tree) {
    tree_path <- here(tree_results_folder, "phylogenetic_tree.nwk")

    if (file_exists(tree_path)) {
        phylo_tree <- read.tree(tree_path)

# Construct Phyloseq Object(s)

## Build Phyloseq Objects

Every combination of taxonomy database x available abundance source gets
its own phyloseq object, keyed by a `combo_id` of the form
`<db_name>_<abundance_source>` (e.g. `SILVA_raw_counts`,
`SILVA_copy_number_corrected`, `GTDB_microbial_load_corrected`). A
parallel `phyloseq_combo_meta` list stores each combo’s display metadata
(taxonomy database, full abundance-source name, and its Excel-safe short
label) so every downstream section can look up how to label its output
without recomputing anything.

## Explore Phyloseq Objects

For every phyloseq object built above, this chunk prints basic
composition statistics (taxa/sample counts, total reads) and, per
taxonomic rank, how many ASVs could not be classified – a quick sanity
check before moving on to aggregation and visualization.

``` r
for (combo_id in names(phyloseq_objects)) {

    ps <- phyloseq_objects[[combo_id]]
    meta <- phyloseq_combo_meta[[combo_id]]

    cat("\n", meta$db_name, "-", meta$source_display, "phyloseq summary:\n")

    cat("  Sample names:", paste(head(sample_names(ps), 5), collapse = ", "),
        ifelse(nsamples(ps) > 5, "...", ""), "\n")
    cat("  Total abundance:", format(sum(sample_sums(ps)), big.mark = ","), "\n")
    cat("  Has sample data:", !is.null(sample_data(ps, errorIfNULL = FALSE)), "\n")

## Save Phyloseq Objects

This chunk writes each phyloseq object built above to its own `.RData`
file, inside that combination’s database-specific `phyloseq_objects/`
subfolder
(e.g. `SILVA/phyloseq_objects/phyloseq_object_silva_raw_counts.RData`,
`GTDB/phyloseq_objects/phyloseq_object_gtdb_raw_counts.RData`), so each
one can be reloaded independently in downstream analysis scripts without
re-running this notebook.

``` r
# results='asis' + cat() (rather than print()) is required for
# render_output_links()'s Markdown output to actually render as a clickable
# link -- render_output_links() returns a knitr::asis_output() object (a
# character string tagged for raw-Markdown insertion), and that tagging is
# only honoured when knitr auto-prints a chunk's own top-level return value.
# An explicit print() call inside a for loop bypasses that auto-print path
# entirely and falls back to base R's print.default(), which dumps the
# object's raw character content AND its class/attribute metadata as
# literal visible text (e.g. `[1] "- [text](url)" attr(,"class") ...`)

# Taxonomic Aggregation

## Aggregate at Genus Level

For every phyloseq object built above, this chunk collapses ASVs sharing
the same Genus assignment into a single row using phyloseq’s
[tax_glom()](https://joey711.github.io/phyloseq/) (`NArm = FALSE`, so
unclassified ASVs are kept as their own group rather than dropped), then
also computes a genus-level relative-abundance version for later
visualization.

``` r
# Store aggregated objects, keyed by combo_id
genus_objects <- list()
genus_relative <- list()

for (combo_id in names(phyloseq_objects)) {

    ps <- phyloseq_objects[[combo_id]]
    meta <- phyloseq_combo_meta[[combo_id]]

    cat("\nAggregating", combo_id, "at Genus level...\n")

    # Aggregate the OTU table at the genus level
    ps_genus <- tax_glom(ps, taxrank = "Genus", NArm = FALSE)
    genus_objects[[combo_id]] <- ps_genus

    cat("  Original ASVs:", ntaxa(ps), "\n")
    cat("  Unique genera:", ntaxa(ps_genus), "\n")

    # Calculate relative abundances at the genus level
    if (any(sample_sums(ps_genus) <= 0)) {
        stop(combo_id, " has a zero-total sample after genus aggregation.")
    }
    ps_genus_rel <- transform_sample_counts(ps_genus, function(x) x / sum(x))
    genus_relative[[combo_id]] <- ps_genus_rel

    cat("  Relative abundance calculated\n")
}
```

## Identify Top Genera

This chunk ranks each combination’s genera by total abundance in that
source table and keeps the top `n_top_taxa` (set in
[Configuration](#define-data-params)), previewing them as an interactive
table and exporting the full ranking to a per-combination Excel sheet.
**Ranking basis**: “total abundance” here means each genus’s abundance
**summed across every sample** within that taxonomy database x abundance
source combination – one shared, dataset-wide top `n_top_taxa`, not a
separate top `n_top_taxa` chosen independently for each individual
sample. A genus that is highly abundant in only one compositionally
distinct sample (e.g. a control or an outlier) can therefore still fall
outside this shared ranking, even though it dominates that one sample’s
own composition – such a genus is simply absent from that combination’s
barplot and Excel sheet, rather than shown with a near-zero value.
Genera with an unclassified (`NA`) Genus assignment are excluded from
the ranking/selection itself – `tax_glom(..., NArm = FALSE)` in
[Aggregate at Genus Level](#aggregate-genus) deliberately collapses
every unclassified ASV into one row rather than dropping it, and that
row is often abundant enough to otherwise occupy a top-N slot that a
named genus should have. `Relative_Abundance` is still computed against
the *total* community (including unclassified reads), so the percentages
shown remain a true share of the whole sample rather than being inflated
by excluding the unclassified fraction from the denominator too.

``` r
top_genera_list <- list()
top_genera_df_list <- list()

# Interactive tables are accumulated here (one per combo_id) rather than
# printed inside the loop -- explicit print() on an htmlwidget inside a for
# loop bypasses knitr's dependency-aware knit_print() method, so the
# widget's JS/CSS dependencies never get registered and it renders blank.
# Auto-printing one combined tagList() as the chunk's own final top-level
# expression (below, after the loop) is what makes knit_print() fire
# correctly for every table.
report_tables <- list()

# Iterate over the genus-level objects built in the preceding section. The

# Visualization

## Define Barplot Function

This chunk defines a reusable helper, `create_taxonomy_barplot()`,
called once per taxonomy database x abundance source combination in the
section below – centralizing the plot styling and the interactive HTML
export in one place instead of repeating it at the call site.

``` r
# Create Interactive Taxonomy Barplot
#
# Generates an interactive barplot of taxonomic composition using ggplot2 and
# plotly. Color-to-taxon mapping is supplied externally via `color_palette`
# (built once, in Assign Consistent Genus Colors, from the union of every
# taxon appearing across ALL combinations processed in this run) rather than
# computed locally from this one call's own taxa -- that is what makes a
# given genus draw in the same color across every plot this notebook
# generates. Previously, each call derived its own palette from only its own
# subset of taxa, so the same genus could land on a different color in every
# combination's plot (and, coincidentally, the same color could be reused
# for two different genera across plots), making cross-plot color
# comparisons meaningless.
#
# Arguments:
#   ps            - A phyloseq object
#   tax_rank      - Taxonomic rank to display (default: "Genus")
#   title         - Plot title
#   y_title       - Y-axis title
#   legend_title  - Legend (color key) title
#   color_palette - Named character vector mapping taxon name -> hex color,
#                   shared across every call to this function in this run
#                   (see Assign Consistent Genus Colors). scale_fill_manual()
#                   matches palette entries to the data by NAME, not by
#                   position, so this stays correct even though each call's
#                   ps object only contains a SUBSET of the palette's full
#                   taxon universe -- unused names in the palette are
#                   silently ignored by ggplot2.
#   output_path   - Path to save HTML file (optional)
# Returns:
#   A plotly object
create_taxonomy_barplot <- function(ps, tax_rank = "Genus", title, y_title, legend_title, color_palette, output_path = NULL) {

    # Generate barplot. The externally-supplied, run-wide color_palette (see
    # Assign Consistent Genus Colors) -- not a palette derived from this
    # call's own taxa -- is what keeps a given genus' color identical across
    # every combination's plot.
    plot <- plot_bar(ps, fill = tax_rank) +
        scale_fill_manual(values = color_palette, name = legend_title) +
        ggtitle(title) +
        labs(x = "", y = y_title) +
        theme_minimal() +
        theme(
            plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 14, face = "bold"),
            axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, size = 8),
            legend.position = "right",
            legend.text = element_text(size = 8)
        )

    # Convert ggplot object to plotly for interactivity. ggplotly() does not
    # reliably carry over a ggplot2 legend title set via scale_*(name = ...)
    # -- a well-documented ggplotly() conversion quirk -- so the legend title
    # is set a second time here, directly on the plotly object via layout(),
    # to guarantee it actually appears as intended in the rendered widget.
    interactive_plot <- ggplotly(plot) %>%
        layout(legend = list(title = list(text = legend_title)))

    # Export the interactive plot to an HTML file if path provided
    if (!is.null(output_path)) {
        saveWidget(interactive_plot, output_path, selfcontained = TRUE)
        cat("  Plot saved to:", output_path, "\n")
    }

    return(interactive_plot)
}
```

## Assign Consistent Genus Colors

So the same genus is always drawn in the same color in every barplot
below – rather than each combination’s plot independently re-deriving
its own color assignment from only its own subset of taxa – this chunk
builds ONE color palette shared across every call to
`create_taxonomy_barplot()`, keyed by genus name. It is built from the
union of every genus appearing in ANY combination’s top `n_top_taxa`
selection ([Identify Top Genera](#top-genera)), sorted alphabetically so
the color assigned to each genus is reproducible and does not depend on
which combination happened to be processed first.

``` r
# Union of every genus name appearing in any combination's top-N selection,
# across every taxonomy database x abundance source combination processed in
# this run -- the full set of genera that could ever need a color below.
# Sorting alphabetically (rather than leaving insertion/discovery order,
# which would depend on combo processing order) makes the color assigned to
# each genus reproducible from one run to the next.
all_top_genera <- sort(unique(unlist(lapply(top_genera_df_list, function(df) df$Genus))))
n_unique_genera_total <- length(all_top_genera)

cat("Building a shared color palette for", n_unique_genera_total,
    "unique genera across", length(top_genera_df_list), "combination(s)...\n")

# RColorBrewer's "Paired" palette is a well-distinguished 12-color
# qualitative palette; colorRampPalette() interpolates it up to however many
# unique genera actually need a color across the whole run, so every genus
# receives its own color regardless of how many total genera are involved.
# The resulting NAMED vector (genus -> hex color) is what
# create_taxonomy_barplot() below matches to each plot's data by name.
genus_color_palette <- setNames(
    if (n_unique_genera_total) colorRampPalette(brewer.pal(12, "Paired"))(n_unique_genera_total) else character(),
    all_top_genera
)
```

## Generate Genus-Level Barplot

For every combination, this chunk generates one interactive
relative-abundance barplot restricted to the top `n_top_taxa` named
genera (see [Identify Top Genera](#top-genera)). Every plot uses the
same genus-to-color mapping built in [Assign Consistent Genus
Colors](#genus-colors), so a genus keeps the same color across abundance
sources and taxonomy databases. The workflow intentionally does not
create unrestricted genus plots, routine species-level plots, or plots
of unnormalized raw counts: unrestricted categorical plots quickly
become unreadable, raw read totals are strongly influenced by sequencing
depth, and even full-length 16S reads do not guarantee reliable
species-level classification for every taxon and reference database. The
complete genus- and species-level assignments remain available in the
saved [phyloseq objects](#save-phyloseq), and the selected genus data
are exported in the [Top Genera](#top-genera) workbook sheets. Each
interactive plot is saved in the relevant database-specific `barplots/`
folder under
[results/9_phyloseq_object/](../../results/9_phyloseq_object/).

``` r
# This chunk deliberately does NOT use the results='asis' + print(htmltools::
# tagList(widget)) pattern used elsewhere in this project (e.g.
# 5_dada2_pipeline.md's display-taxonomy-tables chunk) for widgets emitted
# from inside a loop. That pattern renders the widget's container <div> and
# data correctly, but does NOT actually register the widget's own JS/CSS
# library with the document -- verified empirically (rendered to real HTML
# and inspected in an actual browser): the plot area comes out as blank
# space, because base R's print() generic dispatches an htmlwidget-wrapped
# htmltools::tagList() to htmltools' own plain print.shiny.tag.list()
# /print.shiny.tag(), NOT to knitr's dependency-aware knit_print.shiny.tag.list().
# knit_print() -- the method that actually registers a widget's dependencies
# with the document via knitr::knit_meta_add() -- is only invoked
# automatically by knitr's own auto-print machinery, and only for a chunk's
# own top-level, non-nested return value; an explicit print() call buried
# inside a for loop never goes through that path, no matter the chunk's
# results option.
#
# The fix verified to actually work: accumulate every combination's heading,
# plot, and download link as htmltools tags in a single list across the
# whole loop, then auto-print ONE combined htmltools::tagList() as this
# chunk's own last top-level expression (see below, after the loop). That is
# a genuine top-level return value, so knitr's auto-print correctly routes
# it through knit_print.shiny.tag.list() and registers every widget's
# dependencies -- confirmed by rendering this exact pattern and checking
# window.Plotly was defined and the chart's <svg> actually drew in a real
# browser.

```

All interactive genus barplots accumulated above are displayed together
here so every widget renders reliably in the HTML report.

# Sample Statistics

## Per-Sample Abundance

For every combination, this chunk tabulates each sample’s total
abundance in the units of its source table and its observed ASV
richness, previews the table sorted by total abundance, and exports the
full table to Excel. For raw counts the total is reads; for corrected
sources it is a fractional copy-number-corrected total or a
microbial-load-scaled total.

``` r
sample_stats_list <- list()

    # sources only when it goes into the table below. Percentage, sort
    # order, and the console summary further down are all computed from

The complete per-sample abundance tables are displayed below as
scrollable report tables; the same data are written to database-specific
workbooks.

## Taxonomy Summary

For every taxonomy database, this chunk counts how many distinct taxa
are observed at each taxonomic rank and what fraction of ASVs were
successfully classified at that rank, previews the result, and exports
it to Excel as a single `Tax_Summary` sheet. The summary describes the
ASVs retained in that database’s raw-count phyloseq object after any
taxonomy and tree matching, rather than claiming to describe ASVs that
were pruned during construction.

``` r
tax_summary_list <- list()

# Interactive tables are accumulated here (one per db_name) rather than
# printed inside the loop -- explicit print() on an htmlwidget inside a for
# loop bypasses knitr's dependency-aware knit_print() method, so the
# widget's JS/CSS dependencies never get registered and it renders blank.
# The combined tagList() is auto-printed at the very end of this chunk

## Record Run Provenance

Each database workbook records the exact inputs, checksums,
configuration, software versions, and ASV retention for every abundance
object produced in this run.

## Document and Export Column Dictionary

Every `Top_Genera_<source_label>` and `Sample_Stats_<source_label>`
sheet (one per abundance source processed) shares an identical column
layout within a database’s own workbook — only the underlying values
differ; `Tax_Summary` is written once per database and needs no such
per-source repetition. Build one `descriptions` lookup per sheet family
and reuse it for every abundance source’s copy of that sheet, then
combine everything into a trailing `Column_Dictionary` sheet, appended
separately to *each* taxonomy database’s own summary workbook, so every
workbook documents itself independently.

Each database’s generated dictionary is appended as the final sheet of
its own workbook without printing the long dictionary in the report.

Before publishing links, this hidden gate verifies that every expected
object, plot, workbook, and workbook sheet exists for the current run.

The links below open the final database-specific workbooks and their
documented result folders.

# Output File Summary

The tree below lists every file this notebook has written to its own
output folder,
[results/9_phyloseq_object/](../../results/9_phyloseq_object/), as a
clickable, portable link (relative to this notebook’s own location) –
built live from what is actually on disk at knit time via the project’s
shared
[render_output_tree_function.R](../functions/render_output_tree_function.R)
helper. The exact set of `.RData` phyloseq objects, interactive `.html`
barplots, and per-database Excel workbooks depends on which taxonomy
database(s) and optional upstream steps (6-8) were used in this run, so
most filenames here are dynamically generated rather than fixed – only
the database subfolders (top-level, `phyloseq_objects/`, and
`barplots/`) and each database’s summary workbook get an inline
description; every other file’s name is already self-descriptive
(e.g. `phyloseq_object_silva_raw_counts.RData`,
`barplot_genus_top10_raw_counts.html`).

# Appendix: Troubleshooting Guide

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Fewer Phyloseq Objects Than Expected

**Symptom**: The [Build Phyloseq Objects](#build-phyloseq) section
reports fewer combinations than `number of taxonomy databases x 3`.

**Cause**: `copy_number_corrected` and/or `microbial_load_corrected`
abundance tables were not found, because [Step
7](7_copy_number_correction.md) and/or [Step
8](8_microbial_load_correction.md) have not been run. This is expected –
both are optional – and is reported as a skip message, not an error, in
[Load Abundance Tables](#load-abundance).

**Actions**:

- Run [Step 7](7_copy_number_correction.md) and/or [Step
  8](8_microbial_load_correction.md) first if you want the additional
  phyloseq object(s), then re-run this notebook.
- If you only need raw-counts phyloseq objects, no action is needed.

### ASV Names Don’t Match

**Error**: No matching ASVs between OTU table and taxonomy

**Cause**:

- ASV count table uses sample names as row names instead of column
  names.
- Taxonomy table has different ASV IDs.

**Actions**:

- Verify the format of your input files.
- Check that ASV IDs are consistent between files.
- Ensure ASV count table has samples as rows and ASVs as columns.

### Phylogenetic Tree Tips Don’t Match

**Warning**: Not all ASVs have matching tree tips

**Cause**:

- Tree was built with different ASV sequences.
- ASV IDs changed between steps.

**Actions**:

- Rebuild the tree using the same ASV sequences.
- Verify ASV ID consistency across all input files.

### Memory Issues with Large Datasets

**Error**: Cannot allocate memory

**Actions**:

- Process one taxonomy database at a time: temporarily rename or move
  the other database’s taxonomy CSV
  ([silva_taxonomy_table.csv](../../results/5_dada2_pipeline/silva_taxonomy_table.csv)
  or
  [gtdb_taxonomy_table.csv](../../results/5_dada2_pipeline/gtdb_taxonomy_table.csv),
  in [results/5_dada2_pipeline/](../../results/5_dada2_pipeline/)) out
  of that folder before running this notebook, so [Load Taxonomy
  Table(s)](#load-taxonomy) only detects the one you want – restore the
  file afterward to include it on a later run.
- Filter low-abundance ASVs before creating phyloseq object.
- Increase system memory.

### Missing Taxonomy Ranks

**Warning**: NA values in taxonomy table

**Cause**: This is common and expected. Many ASVs cannot be classified
to all taxonomic levels.

**Actions**:

- Use `NArm = FALSE` in `tax_glom()` to retain unclassified taxa.
- Consider using less stringent classification thresholds in [Step
  5](5_dada2_pipeline.md).
